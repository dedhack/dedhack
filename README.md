<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Izhar</h1>
<h3 align="center">New to the world of software development</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [drive-and-track](https://github.com/dedhack/drive-and-track), a vehicle management app!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **HTML CSS Javascript React Express MongoDB Python PostgreSQL**

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/dedhack](https://github.com/dedhack)
- Project-Mario-Zombie: This is 2D platform game based on Vanilla JS and Canvas. It was an interesting project and a start to my coding journey. I've learnt interesting things here, such as game physics like collision blocks.
- Habit-Tracker: This is my second project. I've used React here to build a simple app that as the name suggests, keeps track of a user's habits. Habit tracking is something that I enjoy doing, and this was an attempt to try and build something similar.
- Full-stack website for the Handicaps Welfare Association: This was a group project where we worked together with the UI/UX team to implement their ideas. The technology used here was the MERN stack.
- Drive-and-Track: This was my capstone project, which is a vehicle management app that allows users or business owners to keep track of their fleet of vehicle. The idea is to be aware of the running expenses for fuel and maintenance. I've used the PERN stack here, trying out PostgreSQL instead for the database. This project is something that I felt is useful. I love to log and keep track on my motorcycle and car expenses, and this app was just a natural extension of my passion for all things data and vehicles.
